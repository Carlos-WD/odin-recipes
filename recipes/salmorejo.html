    <h1>Salmorejo</h1>
    <p>
        The traditional salmorejo recipe comes from Cordoba and was made with a mixture of breadcrumbs, garlic, olive oil, salt and tomatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, with time and its expansion, the ingredients have been transformed and expanded, gradually adding new additions such as ham, hard-boiled egg or croutons, among others.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Ca√±a Nature we maintain the character of the traditional Cordovan recipe, but replacing the bread with rice flour. This way we obtain a traditional gluten-free salmorejo, suitable for people with celiac disease.

        But if you want to make the traditional recipe at home, including the breadcrumbs, here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it. This recipe is for 4 people and is much simpler than you might think.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg of Tomatoes</li>
            <li>200 gr. of Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 clove of Garlic</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Serrano Ham</li>
            <li>Quail Eggs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the tomatoes well and cut them in half, then place them in a jar or bowl where you can use the blender. Then use a strainer to remove both the skin and the seeds.</li>
            <li>The resulting puree can be put back into the same bowl. Now include the breadcrumbs as finely chopped as possible and add the chopped garlic, a little salt and oil.</li>
            <li>Blend everything into a homogeneous cream and leave it to cool well in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Cook the quail eggs. Cook the quail eggs. Just 5 minutes from the time the water boils should be enough. Cool them so they don't burn and cut each egg into 4 wedges.</li>
            <li>The Serrano ham is served in small cubes, so cut it so that it looks like this.</li>
            <li>Remove the salmorejo once it is cold and place the egg wedges on top of the cream. Sprinkle with the chopped ham. You decide how the whole presentation should look like.</li>
        </ol>
